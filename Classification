# Proposed PGT Classification Algorithm
PGT_Classification <- function(X_opt, D_train, Y_train, D_test) {
  # Step 1: Classification with Transductive SVM (TSVM)
  
  # Train the TSVM classifier
  tsvm_model <- ksvm(as.matrix(D_train), as.factor(Y_train), type = "tsvm", kernel = "vanilladot")
  
  # Obtain the classifier's score
  f_opt <- predict(tsvm_model, D_test, type = "decision")
  
  # Step 2: Output Class Labels
  
  # Set the threshold value based on empirical evaluation
  f_init <- 0.5  # This is a placeholder value. You should set this based on your empirical evaluation.
  
  if (f_opt > f_init) {
    V <- predict(tsvm_model, D_test)
  } else {
    # Here, you would typically retrain the TSVM with both labeled and unlabeled data.
    # For simplicity, we're using the same model.
    V <- predict(tsvm_model, D_test)
  }
  
  return(V)
}

# Example usage
# Assuming you have X_opt, D_train, Y_train, and D_test datasets ready
# result <- PGT_Classification(X_opt, D_train, Y_train, D_test)
# print(result)
